We use the MAAP Data Processing System (DPS) as a batch computing resource for processing large archival runs in addition to using it as part of the [NRT system](nrt.qmd).

A given FEDS run generates outputs for a user-defined bounding box (region) and date range, generated with certain settings and a particular version of the FEDS codebase. When FEDS is run on DPS, it reads input data from our shared S3 bucket and copies outputs back to that bucket. 

This doc explains how to define a new region (e.g. CONUS, RussiaEast, etc.) to run FEDS on, how to customize which settings it uses, how to run a region manually using the `manual v3` workflow, and how to create a new scheduled job to continue updating your new region in NRT if neccessary.

## Defining a New Region 

 The example below will use the newly created "RussiaEast" region to explain how to define a new region and process it on DPS. 

1. Pick a unique, descriptive region name **that does not already exist** in `FEDSpreprocessed` (e.g. "Russia East")

2. Create a .env file defining the settings you want to use for your region. The meanings of and options for each setting are defined in `FireConsts.py:Settings`. Here is an example .env file: 

    ```bash
    FEDS_FTYP_OPT="global"
    FEDS_CONT_OPT="global"
    FEDS_EPSG_CODE=6933
    FEDS_FIRE_NRT="False"
    FEDS_FIRE_SOURCE="VIIRS"
    FEDS_remove_static_sources="True"   
    ```
::: callout-tip
Working with hidden files (prefixed by a `.`) is difficult in the MAAP ADE, because the GUI file explorer has no way to show them. Use the terminal instead. Another thing you can do is create a file called `env`, edit it with the GUI as needed, then rename it to `.env` when you are done. 
::: 
    ```bash
    # one way to create a .env file directly from the terminal
    (pangeo) root@workspaceqhqrmmz1pim87fsz:~# touch .env
    (pangeo) root@workspaceqhqrmmz1pim87fsz:~# echo -e "FEDS_FTYP_OPT="global"\nFEDS_CONT_OPT="global"\nFEDS_EPSG_CODE=6933\nFEDS_FIRE_NRT="False"\nFEDS_FIRE_SOURCE="VIIRS"\nFEDS_remove_static_sources="True"" >> .env

    # once we have created a .env file locally, inspect it
    (pangeo) root@workspaceqhqrmmz1pim87fsz:~# cat .env 
    FEDS_FTYP_OPT="global"
    FEDS_CONT_OPT="global"
    FEDS_EPSG_CODE=6933
    FEDS_FIRE_NRT="False"
    FEDS_FIRE_SOURCE="VIIRS"
    FEDS_remove_static_sources="True"  
    ```
3. Copy the `.env` file to `Settings.PREPROCESSED_DIR/${regnm}`: 

    ```bash
    # check that region does not already exist
    # (just showing how to list bucket key contents)
    (pangeo) root@workspaceqhqrmmz1pim87fsz:~# aws s3 ls s3://maap-ops-workspace/shared/gsfc_landslides/FEDSpreprocessed/
                           PRE BorealManualV2/
                           PRE BorealNA/
                           PRE CONUS/

    # copy the .env to a new FEDSpreprocessed folder
    (pangeo) root@workspaceqhqrmmz1pim87fsz:~# aws s3 cp /projects/.env s3://maap-ops-workspace/shared/gsfc_landslides/FEDSpreprocessed/RussiaEast/.env
    upload: ./.env to s3://maap-ops-workspace/shared/gsfc_landslides/FEDSpreprocessed/RussiaEast/.env
  
    # check that it exists 
    (pangeo) root@workspaceqhqrmmz1pim87fsz:~# aws s3 ls s3://maap-ops-workspace/shared/gsfc_landslides/FEDSpreprocessed/RussiaEast/
    2024-07-12 05:55:19         66 .env

    ```
::: callout-note
When working with S3, we do not need to explicitly create a folder for the new region. Instead, when we copy the `.env` file to `Settings.PREPROCESSED_DIR/${rgnm}/.env`, S3 infers from the pathname that it should create the new folder automatically. 
:::


## Running Manually 
Now that we have defined a new region, we can manually trigger a run on DPS for a certain time period for that region with the GitHub Action "manual v3" workflow. 

From the main GitHub repo, navigate to the [workflow page](https://github.com/Earth-Information-System/fireatlas/actions/workflows/manual-v3.yaml) for the manual v3 workflow. In the upper right hand corner, select "Run Workflow."

![](images/manual-dispatch.png)

Fill out the input parameters according to the descriptions in the prompt. The most important thing to note is that you should NOT pass the JSON encoded parameter input enclosed in single or double quotes, but rather naked. It should look something like this: 

```
{"regnm": "RussiaEast", "bbox": "[97.16172779881556,46.1226744036175,168.70469654881543,77.81982396998427]", "tst": "[2024,5,1,\"AM\"]", "ted": "[2024,6,1,\"PM\"]", "operation": "--coordinate-all"}
```

The action will submit your job to DPS. When the action completes, this does not mean that your job is done; rather, it means that it was successfully submitted for processing. You can use the MAAP ADE's [Jobs UI](https://docs.maap-project.org/en/develop/system_reference_guide/jobsui.html) to monitor the progress of your job once it has been submitted. Outputs will be copied from the DPS worker to `Settings.OUTPUT_DIR/${regnm}` once the job is complete. 

:::::: {.callout-tip}
The MAAP DPS currently has a 24 hour time limit on jobs. When running on very large regions, you may need to split your job up into smaller time periods in order to avoid this. For example, if you are running over all of CONUS, you should do it in 3 month increments, as these can typically be completed within 24 hours, but an entire year cannot. 

The preceding job must be completed before the next job in the sequence is started so that the computation can pick up where it left off in the last job. 
:::

## Scheduling NRT Runs For Your New Region 

Once you have tested your job manually, you can schedule it to run at constant intervals in order to update the outputs as new data is collected in NRT. 

1. Find an existing v3 scheduled worklow in the `.github/workflows/*.yaml` such as `.github/workflows/schedule-conus-nrt-v3.yaml` and copy it

   ```bash
   cp .github/workflows/schedule-conus-nrt-v3.yaml .github/workflows/schedule-russian-east-nrt-v3.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the new workflow and make sure to change some of the following sections and values. Note that leaving `tst` or `ted` as `[]` means it will run from current year 01/01 to now:

   ```bash
   name: <your region name> nrt v3
   ...
       - name: kick off the DPS job
      uses: Earth-Information-System/fireatlas/.github/actions/run-dps-job-v3@conus-dps
      with:
        algo_name: eis-feds-dask-coordinator-v3
        github_ref: 1.2.3
        username: gcorradini
        queue: maap-dps-eis-worker-128gb
        maap_image_env: ubuntu
        maap_pgt_secret: ${{ secrets.MAAP_PGT }}
        json_params: '{"regnm": "RussiaEast", "bbox": "[97.16172779881556, 46.1226744036175, 168.70469654881543, 77.81982396998427]", "tst": "[2024,5,1,\"AM\"]", "ted": "[]", "operation": "--coordinate-all"}'
   ```

3. Make sure to add the username you use to register the new scheduled job to the `maap_runtime/alert-on-failed-dps-jobs.py` [script](https://github.com/Earth-Information-System/fireatlas/blob/5007e66ee592940cb7f07483addbe5adee261a46/maap_runtime/alert-on-failed-dps-jobs.py#L30) if you want the alerting system to warn us when your scheduled job fails after being submitted to DPS. 

## Running Different FEDS Versions on DPS

By default, the production NRT system runs the latest tagged FEDS version, as detailed in the docs on [releasing](releasing.qmd). However, you aren't limited to using only that particular version of the codebase. You can build a DPS image that uses any version of the codebase you like, and run it as show above. In this section, we will work through an example scenario in which we need to test experimental code on DPS without immediately releasing it into production. 

1. Create a new branch.

:::::: {.callout-note}
Note that in this specific case, unlike in the rest of the project, the branch name cannot contain the `/` character, as this interferes with the MAAP image build later on. So, instead of naming it `zb/feature-branch`, we will just name it `feature-branch`.  
:::
2. In that branch, make whatever changes are needed. 
3. Push changes to your branch on GitHub. 
4. With your branch checked out, edit `maap_runtime/coordinator/algorithm_config.yaml`:
    - Give it a new algorithm name that is different from the production name. For example, `TEST-FEATURE-eis-feds-dask-coordinator-v3`.
    - For `algorithm_version`, where it might currently say something like `1.2.3`, put the name of your branch instead: `feature-branch` in this case.
5. Run through the `maap_runtime/register_all.ipynb` notebook to register the new algorithm you just created. This will cause DPS to:
    - Checkout your branch from remote 
    - Build a new DPS image that has the code from your branch installed on it 
    - Return a log response including a `job_web_url`, which you can use to watch the image build in GitLab CI/CD and troubleshoot any problems
6. Once the image has built successfully, it will be available on DPS. You can then use it via the `manual v3` action on GitHub Actions as described [above](custom_regions.qmd#running-manually). However, a few changes are needed:
    - Use the workflow from your feature branch, not the main branch. 
    - Make sure to input the changed algorithm name you created in `algorithm_config.yaml`. 
    - Input your branch name instead of the latest version number in the "Branch name or version tag" field. 

## How DPS Jobs Pick Up Custom Settings For Your Region

There are several settings, such as EPSG code, that need to be changed depending on the region for which we are running FEDS. The default settings are those stored in `FireConsts.py:Settings`. 
Most custom regions will require some changes to these default settings.

The settings used to run a given region `regnm` on DPS are defined in a `.env` file stored in the `Settings.PREPROCESSED_DIR/${regnm}` folder. If there is no such file here, the default settings are used. 

::: callout-note
`Settings.PREPROCESSED_DIR` points to `s3://maap-ops-workspace/shared/gsfc_landslides/FEDSpreprocessed` in our current production setup. You can see existing regions there. 
:::

A couple points will describe how this all works: 

1. We use the package [pydantic-settings](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-settings) in the fireatlas code to manage 
our settings. If you look at the class declaration in `FireConsts.py` you'll see this piece of config below. This tells us
a few different things:

    ```bash
   class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # read in all env vars prefixed with `FEDS_` they can be in a .env file
    model_config = {
        "env_file": ".env",
        "extra": "ignore",
        "env_prefix": "FEDS_",
    }
    ```

    * if there is a `.env` file available read it and use the key/values there to override any defaults listed in this class
    * if there are variables in the `.env` file that are not declared in this class do not use them
    * everything in the `.env` that will act as an override is prefixed with `FEDS_` 
    (so to override `LOCAL_PATH` in the `.env` you would declare `FEDS_LOCAL_PATH=<value>`)

2. All DPS jobs are kicked off via the `/maap_runtime/run_dps_cli.sh` script. In that file there's a single function and line
that attempts (and gracefully exists) to bring over the `.env` file for a DPS run:

    ```bash
    # TODO: this will have to be changed to be passed dynamically once we want to use other s3 buckets
    copy_s3_object "s3://maap-ops-workspace/shared/gsfc_landslides/FEDSpreprocessed/${regnm}/.env" ../fireatlas/.env
    ```
   
Any imports of the `fireatlas` package should now have these overrides included in calls to `python FireRunDaskCoordinator.py`.
