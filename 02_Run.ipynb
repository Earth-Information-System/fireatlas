    "# Concepts\n",
    "This outputs two dataframes: an `allpixels` dataframe with 1 row per pixel and an `allfires` geodataframe with one row per-fire/per-t. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept is that if you use a dataframe to back the allfires and fire objects there are well-defined ways to serialize that to disk whenever you like (aka no more pickles!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a bit of an overview of the lifecycle of each of these dataframes:\n",
    "\n",
    "## allpixels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the start of `Fire_Forward` all of the preprocessed pixel data is loaded and concatenated into one long dataframe.\n",
    "- Each row represents a fire pixel and there is a unique id per row.\n",
    "- As `Fire_Forward` iterates through the timesteps of interest the `allpixels` dataframe is updated in place.\n",
    "- Each `Fire` object refers to the `allpixels` object as the source of truth and does not hold pixel data but instead refers to subsets of the `allpixels` dataframe to return `n_pixels` or `newpixels`.\n",
    "- Merging fires at a particular `t` can update the `allpixels` at a former timestep.\n",
    "- When `Fire_Forward` is complete, the `allpixels` object can be serialized to csv (or any tabular format) optionally partitioned into files by `t`.\n",
    "- This dataframe can be used:\n",
    "    - together with `allfires_gdf` to rehydrate the `allfires` object at the latest `t` in order to run `Fire_Forward` on one new ingest file.\n",
    "    - independently to write the `nplist` output file for largefires\n",
    "\n",
    "## allfires_gdf:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the start of `Fire_Forward` a new geodataframe object is initialized. It has a column for each of the `Fire` attributes that take a non-trivial amount of time to compute (`ftype`, `hull`, `fline`...).\n",
    "- As `Fire_Forward` iterates through the timesteps of interest it writes a row for every fire that is burning (aka has new pixels) at the `t`.\n",
    "- So each row contains the information about one fire at one `t`. The index is a MultiIndex of `(fid, t)`\n",
    "- Merging fires at a particular `t` updates the `mergeid` on the existing rows (_this part I am not totally confident is correct_).\n",
    "- When `Fire_Forward` is complete, the `allfires_gdf` object can be serialized to geoparquet (this is the best choice since it contains multiple geometry columns) optionally partitioned into files by `t`.\n",
    "- This geodataframe can be used:\n",
    "    - together with `allpixels` to rehydrate the `allfires` object at the latest `t` in order to run `Fire_Forward` on one new ingest file.\n",
    "    - independently to write all the snapshot and largefires output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: I like that in this branch the `allpixels` dataframe is referenced by all the `Fire` objects but it isn't copied around. This is different from how it works in `preprocess` where each `Fire` object (at each `t`) has its own dataframe. It is also different than the original version of this algorithm where each `Fire` object (at each `t`) holds a bunch of lists."
